            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
